/*
10. Write a program that plays the game “Rock, Paper, Scissors.” If you are not familiar with the
game do some research (e.g., on the web using Google). Research is a common task for
programmers. Use a switch-statement to solve this exercise. Also, the machine should give
random answers (i.e., select the next rock, paper, or scissors randomly). Real randomness is too
hard to provide just now, so just build a vector with a sequence of values to be used as “the next
value.” If you build the vector into the program, it will always play the same game, so maybe
you should let the user enter some values. Try variations to make it less easy for the user to
guess which move the machine will make next
